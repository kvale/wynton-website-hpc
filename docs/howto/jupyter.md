# Jupyter Notebooks

## Nodes to run Jupyter notebooks on

Jupyter notebooks should only be run on the Wynton development nodes. 

## Connect to Jupyter notebook - X2Go

The easiest method to run a Jupyter notebook on one of the dev nodes and interact with it using a remote computer (e.g. your laptop) is to use the X2Go software to connect to one of the dev nodes,then launch a notebook + web browser on the dev node. The GUI window for the web browser will appear on your remote computer and the notebook will be running on Wynton.

- See the Wynton documentation on [installing X2Go](https://wynton.ucsf.edu/hpc/howto/gui-x11fwd.html)
- Use X2Go connect to one of the Wynton dev nodes
- If you have Anaconda Python installed in your home directory, you can launch a notebook using the `jupyter notebook` command from the terminal (the terminal connected by X2Go)
  - the `jupyter notebook` command should also start the web browser
