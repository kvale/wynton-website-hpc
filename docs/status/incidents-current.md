#### <span style="color: orange;">Partial outage due to campus power glitch</span>

**Notice**: The Wynton system experiencing system-wide issues, including the file system, due to a campus power glitch.  To minimize the risk of corrupting the file system, it was decided to shut down the job scheduler and terminate all running jobs.  The power outage at Mission Bay campus happened at 15:13.  Despite diesel-generated backup power started up momentarily, it was enough to affect some of our servers.  The job scheduler will be offline until the impact on Wynton is fully investigated.

#### <span style="color: orange;">X2Go not working on GPU development nodes</span>

**Notice**: X2Go is currently broken on gpudev1 and pgpudev1. Symptom is the session disconnects after successful authentication. We are working on diagnosing the problem with the vendor. In the meantime, please instead use port forwarding for GUI/Jupyter use of gpudev1 and pgpudev1.
