#### <span style="color: orange;">Full downtime</span>

**Update**: The cluster has been shutdown for maintenance.
<br><span class="timestamp">September 27, 21:00 PST</span>

**Notice**: Wynton will be shut down on Tuesday September 27, 2022 at 21:00. We expect the cluster to be back up by the end of the workday on Thursday September 29. This is done to avoid file-system and hardware failures that otherwise may occur when the UCSF Facilities performs maintenance to the power system in Byers Hall.  We will take the opportunity to perform cluster maintenance after the completion of the power-system maintenance.

#### <span style="color: orange;">X2Go not working on GPU development nodes</span>

**Notice**: X2Go is currently broken on gpudev1 and pgpudev1. Symptom is the session disconnects after successful authentication. We are working on diagnosing the problem with the vendor. In the meantime, please instead use port forwarding for GUI/Jupyter use of gpudev1 and pgpudev1.
