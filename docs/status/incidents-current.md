#### <span style="color: orange;">Many GPU nodes down (due to cooling issues)</span>

**Notification**: One of Wynton's ancillary server rooms is having cooling issues.  To reduce the heat load in the room, we had to turn off all the Wynton nodes in the room around 09:45 this morning.  This affects GPU nodes named msg\*gpu\* and a few other regular nodes.  We estimate that the UCSF Facilities to fix the cooling problem by early next week.
