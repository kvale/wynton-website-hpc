### May 25-26, 2021

#### <span style="color: orange;">Full downtime (major maintenance)</span>

**Notice**: The Wynton HPC environment will be shut down late afternoon on Tuesday May 25, 2021, for maintenance.  We expect the cluster to be back online late Wednesday May 26.  To allow for an orderly shutdown of Wynton, the queues have been disabled starting at 3:30 pm on May 25.  Between now and then, only jobs whose runtimes end before that time will be able to start.  Jobs whose runtimes would run into the maintenance window will remain in the queue.

**Preliminary notice**: The Wynton HPC cluster will be undergoing a major upgrade on Wednesday May 26, 2021.  As usual, starting 15 days prior to this day, on May 11, the maximum job run-time will be decreased on a daily basis so that all jobs finishes in time, e.g. if you submit a job on May 16 with a run-time longer than nine days, it will not be able to scheduled and it will be queued until after the downtime.
