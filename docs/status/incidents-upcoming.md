### September 27-29, 2022

#### <span style="color: orange;">Full downtime</span>

**Notice**: Wynton will be shut down on Tuesday September 27, 2022 at 21:00. We expect the cluster to be back up by the end of the workday on Thursday September 29. This is done to avoid file-system and hardware failures that otherwise may occur when the UCSF Facilities performs maintenance to the power system in Byers Hall.  We will take the opportunity to perform cluster maintenance after the completion of the power-system maintenance.
