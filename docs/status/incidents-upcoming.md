#### <span style="color: orange;">Brief network outage</span>

**Noticed**: UCSF Network IT will be performing maintenance on several network switches in the evening and overnight on Monday March 14.  This will _not_ affect jobs running on the cluster. One of the switches is the one which provides Wynton with external network access. When that switch is rebooted, Wynton will be inaccessible for about 15 minutes. This is likely to happen somewhere between 22:00 and 23:00 that evening, but the outage window extends from 21:00 to 05:00 the following morning, so it could take place anywhere in that window.
